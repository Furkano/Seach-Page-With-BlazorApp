# Seach-Page-With-BlazorApp

## Intruduction
  I was wanted to develop a search page application. In this application you can only search book. 
  You can download this application and you can use it. But first of all you need to batch update database.
  Which is the name of database **"books3.json"**.

## Used Technologies
- .Net Core 6
- Elastic Search
- Blazor
